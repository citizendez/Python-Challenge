# Python-Challenge

### PyBank

•  The following script analyzes financial records provided by monthly profit/loss and outputs calculations. The script is written in Python and uses a two column csv file as its data source.   

•  A script to analyze the data is created in Python. The script takes in a profit/loss by date csv file, processes and computes the data, and outputs the result to the console and exports the results to a text file. 

This analysis provides the following results:  
  •	Total number of profit/loss months  
  •	Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the period  
  •	The average changes in "Profit/Losses" over the period  
  •	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the period  
  •	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the period
 



The results of my analasys are as follows:
